# Code of Conduct #

Approved by the Sage community by a vote which ended on November 24, 2014

The Sage community is comprised of an international mixture of mathematicians,
computer scientists, engineers, researchers, teachers, amateurs, and others
with varied backgrounds. This diversity is one of our strengths, but it can
also lead to communication problems and unhappiness. People who love working on
Sage can more effectively collaborate with others if they follow this code.

1. Be friendly and patient.

2. Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people
   of all backgrounds and identities.

3. Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people and you in turn will
   depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and
   developers, so you should take those consequences into account when making
   decisions. Conversely, Sage is constantly evolving, and earlier decisions
   that were made in good faith may sometimes need to be reconsidered.
   Nonetheless, we should still appreciate the hard work done in the past.

4. Be respectful and polite. Not all of us will agree all the time, but
   disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all
   experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that
   frustration to morph into personal attacks. It is important to remember that
   a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a
   productive one. Members of the Sage community should be respectful when
   dealing with other developers and users.

   When we disagree, we should try to understand why. Disagreements, both
   social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve
   disagreements and differing views constructively. Being unable to understand
   why someone holds a viewpoint does not mean that they are wrong. Do not
   forget that it is human to err. Blame alone gets us nowhere, it is better to
   help resolve issues so we can all learn from our mistakes.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report
it to https://groups.google.com/g/sage-abuse. The group administrators will
consider the issue and explore resolutions. It is also possible to move heated
discussions to https://groups.google.com/g/sage-flame.


## Examples of problematic conduct ##

Sometimes even conduct that is intended to be helpful can be offensive to others.

- Do not attempt to manage other developers' time and focus. Always remember
  that different people contribute to the project with a variety of motivations
  and constraints. For you, time that you can set aside for Sage development
  may be very scarce; but for others, for example hobbyists, it might simply not
  be a relevant constraint. Moreover, keep in mind that in real life, it
  is supervisors who manage time and assignments of their subordinates.

- Do not dismiss other people's efforts on an aspect of the project because you
  feel that other aspects are more important or more urgent for the project.
  Always remember that different people contribute to the project on the basis
  of a variety of expertise, motivations, and priorities.


## The sage-abuse committee ##

The sage-abuse committee was established in 2014 with the adoption of the
Code of Conduct by majority vote; the post
https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/XON6NTJa33o/m/RP_oFsfPBQAJ has a
selection of quotes from the 2014 discussion.

Types of sanctions that the sage-abuse committee has used in the past include
the following:

- Deleting comments (on GitHub Issues/PRs and Google Groups) that violate
  the Code of Conduct.

- Setting Google Groups to hold posts of a participant for moderation
  by an administrator.

- Privilege changes in the GitHub organization.

  - Removing the Maintainer role of a participant.

  - Removing a participant from the Triage team.


### How the committee will respond to reports ###

TODO: Build upon good examples such as
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/dev/conduct/report_handling_manual.html#how-the-committee-will-respond-to-reports


TODO: Analysis of what specific possible sanctions do -- and don't do --
as part of the resolution process.

- Deleting comments (on GitHub Issues/PRs and Google Groups) that violate
  the Code of Conduct:

  - This eliminates the potential of damage that the violations can cause
    in the future, when participants visit the Issues/PRs or Google Groups
    on the web.

  - It does not eliminate the damage that the violations have already caused
    between the time that the violating comment is posted and the time of
    deletion.

  - It does not eliminate the damage that the violations are causing via
    email (notifications of subscribers to GitHub Issues/PRs, Google Groups
    as mailing lists).


### Retaining an archive of all activities of the committee ###

- Before deleting a comment (on GitHub Issues/PRs and Google Groups),
  a screenshot should be taken.


### Appointment procedure ###

TBD
