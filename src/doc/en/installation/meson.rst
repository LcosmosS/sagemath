Building from source using Meson
================================

This is a short guide on how to build the Sage from source using Meson.

Walkthrough
===========

Assume we're starting from a clean repo and a fully set up conda environment::
        
    ```bash 
    ./bootstrap-conda
    mamba env create --file src/environment-dev-3.11.yml --name sage-dev
    conda activate sage-dev
    ```

Alternatively, install all build requirements as described in section
:ref:`section-prereqs`.

.. NOTE::

    If you have previously build Sage in-place, you first have to delete the
    already compiled files, e.g. with ``shopt -s globstar`` followed by 
    ``rm src/**/*.so`` or ``for f in src/**/*.so ; do mv "$f" "$f.old"; done``.
    Also uninstall the 'old' sage packages with ``pip uninstall sage-conf sage-setup sagemath-standard``.

To compile and install the project in editable install, just use::
    
    ```bash
    pip install --no-build-isolation --editable .
    ```

This will install Sage in the current Python environment. You can then start
Sage from the command line with ``./sage`` or run the tests with ``./sage -t``.

.. NOTE::
    
    By using ``pip install --editable`` in the above steps, the Sage library 
    is installed in editable mode. This means that when you only edit source
    files, there is no need to rebuild the library; it suffices to restart Sage.
    Note that this even works when you edit Cython files, so you no longer need
    to manually compile after editing Cython files.

.. NOTE::

    Note that ``make`` is not used at all, nor is ``configure``.
    This means that any Sage-the-distribution commands such as ``sage -i`` 
    will not work.

Background information
======================

Under the hood, pip invokes meson to configure and build the project.
We can also use meson directly as follows.

To configure the project, we need to run the following command::

    ```bash
    meson setup builddir --prefix=$PWD/build-install
    ```

This will create a build directory ``builddir`` that will hold the build artifacts.
The ``--prefix`` option specifies the directory where the Sage will be installed.
To compile the project, run the following command::

    ```bash
    meson compile -C builddir
    ```

Installing is done with the following command::

    ```bash
    meson install -C builddir
    ```

This will then install in the directory specified by ``--prefix``, e.g.
`build-install/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sage`.
Usually, this directory is not on your Python path, so you have to use::

    ```bash
    PYTHONPATH=build-install/lib/python3.11/site-packages ./sage
    ```

Alternatively, we can still use pip to install::

    ```bash
    pip install --no-build-isolation --config-settings=builddir=builddir --editable .
    ```

.. tip::

    Package maintainers may want to specify further build options or need
    to install to a different directory than the install prefix.
    Both are supported naturally by Meson::
    
        ```bash
        meson setup builddir --prefix=/usr --libdir=... -Dcpp_args=...
        meson compile -C builddir
        DESTDIR=/path/to/staging/root meson install -C builddir
        ```
    
    See `Meson's quick guide <https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html#using-meson-as-a-distro-packager>`_
    and `Meson's install guide <https://mesonbuild.com/Installing.html#destdir-support>`_
