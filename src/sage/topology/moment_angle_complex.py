    r"""
    A moment-angle complex.

    Given a simplicial complex `K`, with a set of vertices
    `V = \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}`, a moment-angle complex over `K` is a
    topological space `Z`, which is a union of `X_{\sigma}`, where
    `\sigma \in K`, and `X_{\sigma} = Y_{v_1} \times Y_{v_2} \times \cdots
    \times Y_{v_n}` and `Y_{v_i}` is a 2-disk (a 2-simplex) if
    `v_i \in \sigma` , or a 1-sphere otherwise.

    .. MATH::

        Y_{v_i} =
        \begin{cases}
            D^2, &v_i \in \sigma,\\
            S^1, &v_i \notin \sigma.
        \end{cases}

    .. NOTE::

        The mentioned union is not a disjoint union of topological spaces.
        The unit disks and the unit spheres are considered subsets of `\CC`,
        so the union is just a normal union of subsets of `\CC^n`.

    Here we view moment-angle complexes as cubical complexes and
    try to compute mostly things which would not require computing
    the moment-angle complex itself, but rather work with the
    corresponding simplicial complex.

    .. NOTE::

        One of the more useful properties will be the
        :meth:`bigraded Betti numbers
        <sage.topology.simplicial_complex.bigraded_betti_numbers>`,
        and the underlying theorem which makes this possible is Hochter's
        formula, which can be found on page 104 of [BP2014]_.

    INPUT:

    - ``simplicial_complex`` -- an instance of ``SimplicialComplex``,
      or an object from which an instance of ``SimplicialComplex`` can be
      created (e.g., list of facets), which represents the associated
      simplicial complex over which this moment-angle complex is created

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: MomentAngleComplex([[1,2,3], [2,4], [3,4]])
        Moment-angle complex of Simplicial complex with vertex set
        (1, 2, 3, 4) and facets {(2, 4), (3, 4), (1, 2, 3)}
        sage: X = SimplicialComplex([[0,1], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3]])
        sage: Z = MomentAngleComplex(X); Z
        Moment-angle complex of Simplicial complex with vertex set
        (0, 1, 2, 3) and facets {(0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}
        sage: M = MomentAngleComplex([[1], [2]]); M
        Moment-angle complex of Simplicial complex with vertex set
        (1, 2) and facets {(1,), (2,)}

    We can perform a number of operations, such as find the dimension or
    compute the homology::

        sage: M.homology()
        {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: Z}
        sage: Z.dimension()
        6
        sage: Z.homology()
        {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: Z x Z, 4: Z, 5: Z, 6: Z}

    If the associated simplicial complex is an `n`-simplex, then the
    corresponding moment-angle complex is a polydisc (a complex ball) of
    complex dimension `n+1`::

        sage: Z = MomentAngleComplex([[0, 1, 2]]); Z
        Moment-angle complex of Simplicial complex with vertex set (0, 1, 2)
        and facets {(0, 1, 2)}

    This can be seen by viewing the components used in the construction
    of this moment-angle complex by calling :meth:`components()`::

        sage: Z.components()
        {(0, 1, 2): [The 2-simplex, The 2-simplex, The 2-simplex]}

    If the associated simplicial complex is a disjoint union of 2 points,
    then the corresponding moment-angle complex is homeomorphic to a boundary
    of a 3-sphere::

        sage: Z = MomentAngleComplex([[0], [1]]); Z
        Moment-angle complex of Simplicial complex with vertex set
        (0, 1) and facets {(0,), (1,)}
        sage: dict(sorted(Z.components().items()))
        {(0,): [The 2-simplex, Minimal triangulation of the 1-sphere],
         (1,): [Minimal triangulation of the 1-sphere, The 2-simplex]}

    The moment-angle complex passes all the tests of the test suite relative
    to its category::

    """

        ALGORITHM:

        This algorithm is adopted from Theorem 4.5.8 of [BP2014]_.

        The (co)homology of the moment-angle complex is closely related
        to the (co)homologies of certain full subcomplexes of the
        associated simplicial complex. More specifically, we know that:

        .. MATH::

            H_l(\mathcal{Z}_\mathcal{K}) \cong
            \bigoplus_{J \subseteq [m]} \widetilde{H}_{l-|J|-1}(\mathcal{K}_J),

        where `\mathcal{Z}_\mathcal{K}` denotes the moment-angle complex
        associated to a simplicial complex `\mathcal{K}`, on the set of
        vertices `\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, m\} =: [m]`. `\mathcal{K}_J` denotes the
        full subcomplex of `\mathcal{K}`, generated by a set of vertices `J`.
        The same formula holds true for cohomology groups as well.

        .. SEEALSO::

            :meth:`.cell_complex.GenericCellComplex.homology`

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: Z = MomentAngleComplex([[0,1,2], [1,2,3], [3,0]]); Z
            Moment-angle complex of Simplicial complex with vertex set
            (0, 1, 2, 3) and facets {(0, 3), (0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 3)}
            sage: Z = MomentAngleComplex([[0,1,2], [1,2,3], [3,0]])
            sage: Z.homology()
            {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: Z x Z, 6: Z, 7: 0}
            sage: Z.homology(base_ring=GF(2))
            {0: Vector space of dimension 0 over Finite Field of size 2,
             1: Vector space of dimension 0 over Finite Field of size 2,
             2: Vector space of dimension 0 over Finite Field of size 2,
             3: Vector space of dimension 0 over Finite Field of size 2,
             4: Vector space of dimension 0 over Finite Field of size 2,
             5: Vector space of dimension 2 over Finite Field of size 2,

        This yields the same result as creating a cubical complex
        from this moment-angle complex, and then computing its (co)homology,
        but that is incomparably slower and is really only possible when
        the associated simplicial complex is very small::

            sage: Z = MomentAngleComplex([[0,1], [1,2], [2,0]]); Z
            Moment-angle complex of Simplicial complex with vertex set
            (0, 1, 2) and facets {(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)}

        and works well even with significantly larger underlying simplicial
        complexes::

            First we lift the cohomology classes to their cocycle
            representatives (which are generators of cohomology groups of all
            full subcomplexes of the simplicial complex associated with the

            using chain contractions of the appropriate simplicial complex.
